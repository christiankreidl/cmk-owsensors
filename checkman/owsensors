description:
 Checks the output of '{sensors}' connected to a host by 1-wire bus. It requires the owfs library and uses a TCP-connection to the owserver running on localhost:4304 to retrieve data using an check_mk-agent plugin.

examples:
 set names for the 1-wire sensors:
  set "alias = /etc/owfs-alias.txt" in /etc/owfs.conf
  List the sensor adresses and names in /etc/owfs-alias.txt:
   /28.9669D6070000 AC-unit-intake
   /26.6F6CE1010000 Rack1-Top

inventory:
 Each host which provides the section in the check_mk agent gets one Sensor_XXX service per reported sensor.

perfdata: 
 One variable: the current sensor value.
 Four variables on the humidity sensors: rel. and abs. humidity, temperature and calculated dewpoint.
